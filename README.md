## Installation
First, ensure the repository is cloned and you are on the right branch

### Local installation

The following commands assume that you are **inside the root directory of the package**
(i.e. the directory containing `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`).

```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
pip install -e .
```
Alternatively, a command with the absolute path can be used:

```bash
py -m pip install -e C:\Users\flori\Desktop\CoMe\eradist
```

or

```bash
pip install -e absolute\path\to\eradist
```
